Celestial Creature

	Celestial creatures dwell on the upper planes, the realms of good, although they resemble beings found on the Material Plane. They are more regal and more beautiful than their earthly counterparts.

	Celestial creatures often come in metallic colors (usually silver, gold, or platinum). They can be mistaken for 
half-celestials
, more powerful creatures that are created when a celestial mates with a non-celestial creature.

Creating A Celestial Creature

	"Celestial" is an inherited 
template
 that can be added to any corporeal 
aberration
, 
animal
, 
dragon
, 
fey
, 
giant
, 
humanoid
, 
magical beast
, 
monstrous humanoid
, 
plant
, or 
vermin
 of good or neutral 
alignment
 (referred to hereafter as the base creature).

	A celestial creature uses all the base creature’s statistics and abilities except as noted here. Do not recalculate the creature’s Hit Dice, base attack bonus, saves, or skill points if its type changes.

Size and Type


Animals
 or 
vermin
 with this template become 
magical beasts
, but otherwise the creature type is unchanged. Size is unchanged. Celestial creatures encountered on the Material Plane have the 
extraplanar subtype
.

Special Attacks

	A celestial creature retains all the special attacks of the base creature and also gains the following attack.

Smite Evil (
Su
)

	Once per day a celestial creature can make a normal melee attack to deal extra damage equal to its HD (maximum of +20) against an evil foe.

Darkvision
 out to 60 feet.

 (see the table below).

Spell resistance

 are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
