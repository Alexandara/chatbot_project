Disguise (Cha)

Check

	Your Disguise check result determines how good the disguise is, and it is opposed by others’ 
Spot
 check results. If you don’t draw any attention to yourself, others do not get to make 
Spot
 checks. If you come to the attention of people who are suspicious (such as a guard who is watching commoners walking through a city gate), it can be assumed that such observers are 
taking 10
 on their 
Spot
 checks.

	You get only one Disguise check per use of the skill, even if several people are making 
Spot
 checks against it. The Disguise check is made secretly, so that you can’t be sure how good the result is.

	The effectiveness of your disguise depends in part on how much you’re attempting to change your appearance.



Familiarity

Viewer’s 
Spot
Check Bonus



Recognizes on sight

+4



Friends or associates

+6



Close friends

+8



Intimate

+10



	If you are impersonating a particular individual, those who know what that person looks like get a bonus on their 
Spot
 checks according to the table below. Furthermore, they are automatically considered to be suspicious of you, so opposed checks are always called for.

	Usually, an individual makes a 
Spot
 check to see through your disguise immediately upon meeting you and each hour thereafter. If you casually meet many different creatures, each for a short time, check once per day or hour, using an average 
Spot
 modifier for the group.

epic usages
 of Disguise.

Action

	Creating a disguise requires 1d3×10 minutes of work.

Try Again

	Yes. You may try to redo a failed disguise, but once others know that a disguise was attempted, they’ll be more suspicious.

Special

	Magic that alters your form, such as 
alter self
, 
disguise self
, 
polymorph
, or 
shapechange
, grants you a +10 bonus on Disguise checks (see the individual spell descriptions). You must succeed on a Disguise check with a +10 bonus to duplicate the appearance of a specific individual using the 
veil
 spell. Divination magic that allows people to see through illusions (such as 
true seeing
) does not penetrate a mundane disguise, but it can negate the magical component of a magically enhanced one.

	You must make a Disguise check when you cast a 
simulacrum
 spell to determine how good the likeness is.

	If you have the 
Deceitful
 feat, you get a +2 bonus on Disguise checks.

Synergy

	If you have 5 or more ranks in 
Bluff
, you get a +2 bonus on Disguise checks when you know that you’re being observed and you try to act in character.
