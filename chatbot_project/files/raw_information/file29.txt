Q:

Do you have a downloadable version of this site?



A:


				Not at this time.			






Q:

Why are some monsters missing from this site?



A:


				The following monsters are considered "Product Identity" by Wizards of the Coast and are therefore not part of the SRD:			


beholder

gauth

carrion crawler

displacer beast

githyanki

githzerai

kuo-toa

mind flayer

slaad

umber hulk

yuan-ti







Q:

Where's the experience point table?



A:


				The d20 license restricts some information from being included. Specifically…			

				"No Covered Product may contain rules or instructions of any kind that:			


Describe a process for Creating a Character

Describe a process for Applying the Effects of Experience to a Character"







Q:

Do you plan to add d20 Modern SRD content?



A:


				I don't have any plans to include the d20 Modern SRD. I have my hands very full with the basic (fantasy) SRD.			

				There is a very attractive HTML version of the d20 Modern SRD here:

Q:

Do you plan to add content from other sourcebooks to this site?



A:


				I cannot include content from any sourcebook unless that content has been released under the 
Open Gaming License
 (OGL). 
This site currently contains content from 
all
 sourcebooks published by Wizards of the Coast that contain open content.
 This includes open content from the following books published in the official d20 SRD:			


Player's Handbook

Dungeon Master's Guide

Monster Manual

Epic Level Handbook

Deities and Demigods

Expanded Psionics Handbook


				In addition, the following open game content has also been included:			


Razor Boar
 and 
Scorpionfolk
 from 
Monster Manual II

"Variant Rules" from 
Unearthed Arcana


				Hopefully there will be content from other sourcebooks released under the OGL in the future. When that happens, you can be assured that I will include it on this site.
