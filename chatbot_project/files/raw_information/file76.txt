	Constrictor snakes usually are not aggressive and flee when confronted. They hunt for food but do not attempt to make a meal out of any creature that is too large to 
constrict
.

Combat

	Constrictor snakes hunt by grabbing prey with their mouths and then squeezing it with their powerful bodies.

Constrict
 (
Ex
)

	On a successful 
grapple check
, a constrictor snake deals 1d3+4 points of damage.

Improved Grab
 (
Ex
)

	To use this ability, a constrictor snake must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a 
grapple
 as a 
free action
 without provoking an 
attack of opportunity
. If it wins the 
grapple check
, it establishes a hold and can constrict.

Constrictor Snake, Giant

	Giant constrictor snakes are more aggressive than their smaller cousins, principally because they need a great amount of food to survive.
