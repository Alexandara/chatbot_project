Gather Information (Cha)

Check

	An evening’s time, a few gold pieces for buying drinks and making friends, and a DC 10 Gather Information check get you a general idea of a city’s major news items, assuming there are no obvious reasons why the information would be withheld. The higher your check result, the better the information.

	If you want to find out about a specific rumor, or a specific item, or obtain a map, or do something else along those lines, the DC for the check is 15 to 25, or even higher.

Try Again

	Yes, but it takes time for each check. Furthermore, you may draw attention to yourself if you repeatedly pursue a certain type of information.

Special

	A half-elf has a +2 racial bonus on Gather Information checks.

	If you have the 
Investigator
 feat, you get a +2 bonus on Gather Information checks.

Synergy

	If you have 5 or more ranks in 
Knowledge
 (local), you get a +2 bonus on Gather Information checks.
