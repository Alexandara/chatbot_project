Mephit 

	Mephits are minor creatures from the elemental planes.

	All mephits appear as small, winged creatures with more or less humanoid features. While they are often described as impish, their elemental origins are apparent at first glance.

Combat

	All mephits fight by biting and clawing or by using a 
breath weapon
, the nature and effects of which vary from creature to creature.

	A mephit’s 
natural weapons
 are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming 
damage reduction
.

Breath Weapon
 (
Su
)

	A mephit can use its 
breath weapon
 once every 1d4 rounds as a 
standard action
. See the individual descriptions for details.

Spell-Like Abilities

	All mephits have one or more 
spell-like abilities
 (save DC 12 + spell level). See the individual descriptions for details.

Summon
 Mephit (
Sp
)

	Once per day, a mephit can attempt to 
summon
 another mephit of the same variety, much as though casting a summon monster spell, but with only a 25% chance of success. Roll d%: On a failure, no creature answers the summons that day. A mephit that has just been summoned cannot use its own summon ability for 1 hour. This ability is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.

Fast Healing
 (
Ex
)

	Mephits heal 2 points of damage each round, provided they are still alive and certain other conditions are met. See the individual descriptions for details.

	Steam mephits come from the Elemental Plane of Fire.

	Steam mephits are bossy creatures who consider themselves the lords of all their kind. Each one is about 4 feet tall and weighs about 2 pounds.

	Steam mephits speak Common and Ignan.

Combat

	Unlike other mephits, steam mephits rush into combat eagerly, driven by an oversized ego.

Breath Weapon
 (
Su
)

	10-foot cone of steam, damage 1d4 fire, Reflex DC 12 half. Living creatures that fail their saves are tormented by burned skin and seared eyes unless they have 
immunity to fire
 or are otherwise protected. This effect imposes a -4 penalty to AC and a -2 penalty on 
attack rolls
 for 3 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +1 racial bonus.

Spell-Like Abilities

	Once per hour a steam mephit can surround itself with a plume of vapor, duplicating the effect of a 
blur
 spell (caster level 3rd). Once per day it can create a rainstorm of boiling water that affects a 20-foot-square area. Living creatures caught in the storm take 2d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 14 half; caster level 6th). This ability is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

Fast Healing
 (
Ex
)

	A steam mephit heals only if it is touching boiling water or is in a hot, humid area.

	Water mephits come from the Elemental Plane of Water.

	Water mephits are jaunty creatures with an unflagging sense of humor who quickly get on the nerves of everyone around them. Each one is about 4 feet tall and weighs about 30 pounds.

	Water mephits speak Common and Aquan.

Combat

Breath Weapon
 (
Su
)

	15-foot cone of caustic liquid, damage 1d8 acid, Reflex DC 13 half. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +1 racial bonus.

Spell-Like Abilities

	Once per hour a water mephit can hurl an acidic blob that functions like 
acid arrow
 (caster level 3rd). Once per day it can create a mass of smelly fog that duplicates the effect of a 
stinking cloud
 spell (DC 15, caster level 6th). The save DC is Charisma-based.

Fast Healing
 (
Ex
)

	A water mephit heals only if it is exposed to rain or submerged up to its waist in water.

Skills

	A water mephit has a +8 racial bonus on any 
Swim
 check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to 
take 10
 on a 
Swim
 check, even if distracted or endangered.

	It can use the 
run
 action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.
