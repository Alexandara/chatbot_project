Appraise (Int) Check You can appraise common or well-known objects with a DC 12 Appraise check. Failure means that you estimate the value at 50% to 150% (2d6+3 times 10%,) of its actual value. Appraising a rare or exotic item requires a successful check against DC 15, 20, or higher. If the check is successful, you estimate the value correctly; failure means you cannot estimate the item’s value. A magnifying glass  gives you a +2 circumstance bonus  on Appraise checks involving any item that is small or highly detailed, such as a gem. A merchant’s scale  gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Appraise checks involving any items that are valued by weight, including anything made of precious metals. These bonuses stack. See also: epic usages  of Appraise. Action Appraising an item takes 1 minute (ten consecutive full-round actions ). Try Again No. You cannot try again on the same object, regardless of success. Special A dwarf  gets a +2 racial bonus on Appraise checks that are related to stone or metal items because dwarves are familiar with valuable items of all kinds (especially those made of stone or metal). The master of a raven  familiar  gains a +3 bonus on Appraise checks. A character with the Diligent  feat gets a +2 bonus on Appraise checks. Synergy If you have 5 ranks in any Craft  skill, you gain a +2 bonus on Appraise checks related to items made with that Craft  skill. Untrained For common items, failure on an untrained check means no estimate. For rare items, success means an estimate of 50% to 150% (2d6+3 times 10%). - GOOGLE 300x250 ADS - - LEFT -  /1004459/d20srd300x250-1 - RIGHT -  /1004459/d20srd300x250-2 - END GOOGLE 300x250 ADS - The Hypertext d20 SRD TM  is owned by BoLS Interactive LLC .
