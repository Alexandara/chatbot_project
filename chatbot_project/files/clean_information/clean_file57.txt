These modifiers stack. Lightly obstructed +2 Severely obstructed +5 Lightly slippery +2 Severely slippery +5 Sloped or angled +2 Check You can walk on a precarious surface. A successful check lets you move at half your speed along the surface for 1 round. A failure by 4 or less means you can’t move for 1 round. A failure by 5 or more means you fall. The difficulty varies with the surface, as follows: Being Attacked while Balancing You are considered flat-footed  while balancing, since you can’t move to avoid a blow, and thus you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC (if any). If you have 5 or more ranks in Balance, you aren’t considered flat-footed  while balancing. If you take damage while balancing, you must make another Balance check against the same DC to remain standing. Accelerated Movement You can try to walk across a precarious surface more quickly than normal. If you accept a -5 penalty, you can move your full speed as a move action . (Moving twice your speed in a round requires two Balance checks, one for each move action used.) You may also accept this penalty in order to charge  across a precarious surface; charging requires one Balance check for each multiple of your speed (or fraction thereof) that you charge.

Special If you have the Agile  feat, you get a +2 bonus on Balance checks. Synergy If you have 5 or more ranks in Tumble , you get a +2 bonus on Balance checks. - GOOGLE 300x250 ADS - - LEFT -  /1004459/d20srd300x250-1 - RIGHT -  /1004459/d20srd300x250-2 - END GOOGLE 300x250 ADS - The Hypertext d20 SRD TM  is owned by BoLS Interactive LLC .
